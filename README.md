## Visualizing-US-Natural-Disaster-Declarations-Trends-And-Patterns

### Problem Statement

Natural disasters impact the U.S. every year, but raw FEMA datasets are large, complex, and hard to interpret. Decision-makers struggle to quickly identify high-risk regions, disaster trends, and program needs.
This project transforms FEMA disaster declaration data into interactive dashboards that reveal patterns, hotspots, trends over time, and assistance program usage to support data-driven disaster preparedness and planning.

### Dataset Description [About Dataset]

FEMA disaster declaration data covering U.S. disaster events, including dates, locations, incident types, and assistance program indicators. The dataset was cleaned and prepared for accurate analysis and visualization.

##### Key information in the dataset:

1 . Disaster declaration dates

2 . Affected states and regions

3 . Incident and designated incident types

4 . Disaster identification details

5 . Assistance program declarations

##### Program declaration indicators included:

1 . Individual Assistance

2 . Public Assistance

3 . Hazard Mitigation

4 . Emergency / Other Programs

### Key Performance Indicators [KPIs]


1 . Total Disaster Declarations – overall disaster volume

2 . Disasters by Incident Type – most frequent disaster categories

3 . State-wise Disaster Count – hotspot identification

4 . Year-wise Disaster Trend – growth or decline over time

5 . Longest Disaster Duration (Days) – prolonged-impact events

6 . Top 5 States vs Others – concentration of disaster risk


### Dashboard Pages [No.of Pages Used For Visualization]

This project presents FEMA U.S. disaster data through three focused dashboards, designed to answer the most important questions at a glance and guide deeper exploration. Each dashboard highlights a different dimension of disaster impact, ensuring clarity, storytelling, and actionable insights.

1 ->Disaster Pulse – When, Where & Impact
This dashboard gives a quick national snapshot of disaster activity over time, highlights geographic hotspots across states, and shows which disaster types occur most frequently. It helps users quickly understand overall trends and where disasters hit the hardest.

2 ->Disaster Hotspots & Severity
This view focuses on regional impact by ranking the most affected states and highlighting areas with prolonged recovery durations. It is useful for identifying high-risk regions and understanding where disaster response and preparedness need more attention.

3 ->Disaster Severity & Duration
This dashboard dives into how long different disaster types last and how severity changes over time, revealing patterns in prolonged disruption and recovery challenges. It helps differentiate between frequent disasters and those that cause long-term impact.

--> Why This Dashboard Design Works [Highlights]

1 . Uses 3 concise dashboards to avoid clutter while covering trends, geography, and severity.

2 . Combines KPI cards with interactive visuals for quick insights and deeper exploration.

3 . Applies maps, line charts, and bar charts to match the nature of each question.

4 . Keeps the layout simple, story-driven, and interview-ready.

5 . Designed for non-technical users to understand disaster patterns quickly.


### Key Insights [Insights,Trends,patterns From The Dashboard]


Trends [What changes over time]

1 . Disaster declarations show a rising trend over the years, with noticeable peaks in recent periods.

2 . The average disaster duration shows periodic spikes, indicating years with prolonged recovery.

Patterns [What repeats or clusters]

1 . Disasters are concentrated in a few hotspot states, showing repeated regional vulnerability.

2 . A small set of disaster types—floods, hurricanes, and severe storms—consistently dominate total events.

3 . High-impact states tend to experience longer recovery durations repeatedly.

Insights [What this means / what we learn]

1 . Disaster risk is increasing and unevenly distributed, requiring targeted preparedness in hotspot regions.

2 . Focusing mitigation on the most frequent disaster types can reduce overall impact significantly.

3 . Long-duration events indicate a need for long-term recovery planning, not just immediate response.



### Recommendations [What Can Improve]

1 . Strengthen preventive measures in highly affected regions

2 . Allocate resources based on frequently declared assistance programs

3 . Use historical patterns to support disaster preparedness planning

4 . Improve data consistency in future records to support better analysis

### Tools Used [In This Project]

1 . Kaggle – Dataset sourcing and initial exploration

2 . Power BI Desktop – Data modeling and dashboard creation

3 . Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

4 . Python – Data analysis and preprocessing

5 . Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory data analysis and experimentation

6 . VS Code – Development and project organization

7 . GitHub – Version control and project documentation
