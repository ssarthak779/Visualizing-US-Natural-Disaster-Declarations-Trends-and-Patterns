📌 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

This project involves the analysis of historical disaster declaration data to identify high-risk regions, dominant disaster types, and long-term trends. Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was developed to visualize disaster declarations across states, analyze temporal patterns, and support data-driven decision-making for disaster preparedness and funding prioritization.

The project was designed to address real-world analytical questions related to disaster management and policy planning.

1.Texas is identified as the most impacted state, with the highest number of disaster declarations.

2.Disaster declarations are concentrated in a limited number of states, indicating uneven regional risk.

3.Floods emerge as the most frequent disaster type across the dataset.

4.Historical trend analysis highlights significant variation across years and decades, with peak disaster activity observed during specific periods.

5.These insights demonstrate how historical data and visualization can support priority-based funding decisions and targeted disaster preparedness strategies.

📌 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 & 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬

During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in building an end-to-end business intelligence solution using Power BI. I worked on cleaning and modeling real-world data, creating DAX measures, and designing interactive dashboards to answer business-oriented questions.

This experience strengthened my ability to:

Convert raw data into meaningful insights

Design dashboards aligned with stakeholder questions

Apply analytical thinking to real-world scenarios

Communicate insights clearly through visual storytelling

🧠 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲

This project demonstrates my ability to combine data analysis, visualization, and business thinking to solve practical problems in disaster management and decision support.

Before starting this internship, I had no prior experience with Power BI or dashboard development. However, through continuous learning, hands-on practice, and mentor guidance, I am now confident in my ability to build end-to-end Power BI projects, perform data analysis, and create meaningful visualizations that communicate insights effectively.

This internship has been a transformational learning experience. Recalling each stage of the journey—from understanding data to designing dashboards—clearly shows how much I have improved, both technically and analytically.

I am truly grateful to Infosys for this opportunity and would like to extend my sincere thanks to our mentor for the constant support, guidance, and encouragement throughout the internship.
