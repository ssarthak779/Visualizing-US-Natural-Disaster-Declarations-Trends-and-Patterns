## 📊 Power BI Project

### 1. Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations: Trends and Patterns

#### Description:  
This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard analyzing over 70 years of US natural disaster data (1953–2024) sourced from FEMA. The objective was to transform raw disaster declaration records into an interactive analytics solution that visualizes severe weather trends, high-risk geographic regions, and seasonal disaster patterns.

#### Key Features & Technical Work:

- **Data Engineering:** Cleaned and transformed raw datasets using Power Query, including merging state codes with full state names, correcting date hierarchies for accurate time-based analysis, and standardizing year formats for consistency.

- **Geospatial Analysis:** Implemented a filled map visualization to analyze geographic distribution of disasters and identify high-impact states such as Texas and California.

- **Time-Series Analysis:** Used time-based visuals and dynamic filtering to analyze disaster trends across years and observe changes in disaster frequency over time.

- **Dashboard Design:** Designed a structured and readable dashboard layout focusing on clarity, trend visibility, and effective comparison of disaster categories and regions.

## 📌 Internship Experience
During this internship, I learned the end-to-end analytics workflow starting from data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization concepts in Power BI. I gained practical understanding of dashboard design, data modeling, and DAX basics while working with real-world disaster data. The experience helped me improve my ability to convert raw datasets into meaningful insights through structured analysis and visualization.
