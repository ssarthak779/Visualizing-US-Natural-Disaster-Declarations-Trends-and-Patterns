### Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations: Trends and Patterns
#### Description
The Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations: Trends and Patterns project analyzes FEMA disaster declaration data to understand the occurrence and impact of natural disasters across the United States. It focuses on studying how disaster declarations change over time, vary across different states, and differ by incident type, using data analysis and visualization techniques to clearly communicate patterns and insights. It:
* Analyzes historical FEMA disaster declaration data
* Identifies temporal trends in natural disasters over the years
* Examines geographical distribution of disasters across US states
* Studies the frequency and types of disaster incidents
* Uses charts, graphs, and maps for clear data visualization
* Summarizes insights to make disaster data easy to understand

## Internship Experience
I feel grateful for this internship as it was a fantastic opportunity to learn and grow in a supportive environment. The guidance from mentor and the collaboration with teammates made the experience very enriching. Since Python was new to me, it was both challenging and exciting to explore and apply it to real-world data.

Key highlights include:
* Learning Python: Preprocessed and cleaned datasets, gaining confidence in handling data for analysis.
* Dashboard Creation: Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize insights effectively.
* Design Skills: Enhanced reports and visuals using Canva and Excel.
* Version Control: Managed project files and submissions using Git & GitHub.
* Soft Skills Development: Improved analytical thinking, problem-solving, presentation skills, teamwork, and time management.

This internship helped me bridge the gap between theory and practice, build a professional portfolio, and gain confidence in handling data-driven projects independently.
